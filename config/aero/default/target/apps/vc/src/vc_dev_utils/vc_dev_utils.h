/** \brief Convert raw YUVY 4:2:2 buffer to JPEG.
**
**  \par Description
**       From V4L2-PIX-FMT-YUYV documenation: In this format each four
**       bytes is two pixels. Each four bytes is two Y's, a Cb and a Cr.
**       Each Y goes to one of the pixels, and the Cb and Cr belong to 
**       both pixels.
**       Example V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUYV 4 Ã— 4 pixel image:
**
**       Byte Order. Each cell is one byte.
**       start + 0:  Y'00 Cb00 Y'01 Cr00 Y'02 Cb01 Y'03 Cr01
**       start + 8:  Y'10 Cb10 Y'11 Cr10 Y'12 Cb11 Y'13 Cr11
**       start + 16: Y'20 Cb20 Y'21 Cr20 Y'22 Cb21 Y'23 Cr21
**       start + 24: Y'30 Cb30 Y'31 Cr30 Y'32 Cb31 Y'33 Cr31
**
**       Color Sample Location.

**      1 Y C Y  Y C Y
**      2 Y C Y  Y C Y
**      3 Y C Y  Y C Y
**
**  \param [in]  Input    The pointer to the raw YUYV 4:2:2 buffer.
**
**  \param [out] Output   The pointer to the buffer to write the 
**                        converted JPEG.
**
**  \param [out] SizeOut  The output size of the compressed JPEG.
**
**  \returns int 0 for success, -1 for null pointer, -2 for an internal
**               libjpeg error.
